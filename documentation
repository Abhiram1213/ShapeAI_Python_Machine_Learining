# Linear Regression Model Documentation

This repository contains a demonstration of a Linear Regression model in Python using the Boston Housing dataset.

## Dataset Description

The Boston Housing dataset is used to train and test the Linear Regression model. The dataset contains features related to housing properties in Boston, such as crime rate, average number of rooms, pupil-teacher ratio, and more. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (MEDV).

## Model Building

1. Import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
2. Load the Boston Housing dataset using `sklearn.datasets.load_boston`.
3. Create a Pandas DataFrame (`boston`) to hold the dataset, including features and target variables.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
5. Initialize a Linear Regression model (`lin_model`) using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`.
6. Fit the model to the training data using `lin_model.fit`.
7. Make predictions on the training and testing data using `lin_model.predict`.
8. Calculate the root mean squared error (RMSE) to evaluate the model's performance.

## Model Performance

The performance of the Linear Regression model is evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE).

### Training Set Performance

The RMSE for the training set is calculated as follows:
```python
# Code to calculate RMSE for training set
y_train_predict = lin_model.predict(X_train)
rmse_train = (np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(Y_train, y_train_predict)))
print("The model performance for the training set")
print('RMSE is {}'.format(rmse_train))


Testing Set Performance
The RMSE for the testing set is calculated as follows:


# Code to calculate RMSE for testing set
y_test_predict = lin_model.predict(X_test)
rmse_test = (np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(Y_test, y_test_predict)))
print("The model performance for the testing set")
print('RMSE is {}'.format(rmse_test))
# Code to calculate RMSE for testing set
y_test_predict = lin_model.predict(X_test)
rmse_test = (np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(Y_test, y_test_predict)))
print("The model performance for the testing set")
print('RMSE is {}'.format(rmse_test))

#cUsage
To run the Linear Regression model on your own dataset, follow these steps:

Ensure you have the required libraries (numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn) installed.
Replace the dataset loading and preprocessing code with your dataset.
Adjust the model evaluation metrics and performance calculations according to your dataset's target variable.
